    \title Actions

    \section1 Overview

    The action inspector shows all QAction instances that exist in the target application. Information about
    the display name, checkable states, and shortcuts with their priorities are displayed.

    The action inspector warns about shortcut conflicts (that is, two QAction instances using the same
    shortcut sequence and thus making it ambiguous) with a warning icon in its shortcut column.

    Actions can also be activated remotely by double-clicking the corresponding entry.
