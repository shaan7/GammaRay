    \title Scene Graph Material

    \section1 Overview

    When having a scene graph node with an attached material selected (such as a QSGGeometryNode instance),
    the scene graph material view shows details about the material property and the used shader code. This
    is primarily accessible via the scene graph browser in the \l{Qt Quick 2 Inspector} tool.

    \image gammaray-qsgmaterial.png

    The upper half of the material view shows the properties of the QSGMaterial instance. This works similarly
    to the generic \l{Properties} view.

    On the lower left a list of associated OpenGL shaders is displayed, the lower right side shows the source
    code of the currently selected shader.
